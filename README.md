# Blinkit Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project presents an end-to-end data analysis of Blinkit (an instant delivery service platform) using Python.
The goal of the analysis was to uncover meaningful business insights from customer behavior, sales patterns, and product trends to aid in decision-making and strategic improvements.

## Key Objectives
Clean, preprocess, and explore the raw Blinkit dataset.

Analyze customer demographics, order patterns, and product preferences.

Visualize important business metrics using various types of plots and charts.

Derive actionable insights to support marketing, operations, and supply chain strategies.

## Tools & Technologies
Python

## Libraries Used:

Pandas (data cleaning and manipulation)

NumPy (numerical operations)

Matplotlib, Seaborn (data visualization)

Plotly (interactive plots where needed)

## Process Flow
Data Collection: The raw data was sourced from Blinkit's datasets.

Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, corrected data types, and filtered irrelevant data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Customer analysis (age groups, frequency of orders)

Product category analysis (top-selling items, trends)

Sales and revenue trends over time

Geographical distribution of orders

Seasonal and time-based order patterns

Created clear, business-focused visualizations to showcase important findings.

Used different chart types like bar plots, pie charts, line graphs.

### ANALYSIS 1

#### Sales by fat Content 

* Low Fat items contribute to the majority of total sales, accounting for approximately 64.6%.

* Regular Fat items make up about 35.4% of the total sales, indicating a smaller but still significant market share.

* Customers seem to prefer Low Fat options over Regular Fat products, suggesting a trend toward healthier choices.

* Marketing or inventory strategies could prioritize Low Fat items to align with consumer preferences and maximize sales.

### ANALYSIS 2

#### Total sales by Item Type

* Fruits and Vegetables dominate sales*, generating the highest revenue (topping at ~178K) compared to other categories, indicating strong consumer demand for perishable goods.
 
* Breads and Health/Hygiene items contribute significantly less*, with bread sales peaking at ~35K, suggesting these categories may require targeted promotions or inventory adjustments.
